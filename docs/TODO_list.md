Let me analyze our current features from the Swagger documentation and compare with Firebase's core offerings:

âœ… **Currently Implemented Features:**

1. **Authentication**
   - Email/Password Authentication
   - JWT Token Management (access/refresh)
   - Email Verification
   - Password Reset
   - User Management (create, disable, metadata)

2. **Document Database (Firestore-like)**
   - CRUD Operations
   - Complex Queries
   - Operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, in, not-in, array-contains)
   - Pagination
   - Sorting

3. **Storage (Firebase Storage-like)**
   - File Upload/Download
   - Metadata Management
   - Presigned URLs
   - Public/Private Access
   - Path-based Organization
   - List Operations (listAll, pagination)
   - Content Type Detection

4. **Email Service**
   - Templated Emails
   - Verification Emails
   - Password Reset Emails

ðŸš« **Missing Core Firebase Features:**

1. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket/Real-time Document Updates
   - Real-time Query Results
   - Presence System

2. **Client SDKs**
   - Flutter/Dart SDK
   - Web SDK
   - Other Platform SDKs

3. **Offline Support**
   - Local Data Persistence
   - Offline Data Sync
   - Conflict Resolution

4. **Security Rules**
   - Declarative Security Rules
   - Path-based Access Control
   - Complex Validation Rules

5. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Usage Statistics
   - Performance Monitoring
   - Error Reporting

My recommendation:
1. **First Priority**: Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - This is a core Firebase feature that many apps depend on
   - Will make our solution much more attractive to Firebase users
   - Critical for real-time apps (chat, live updates, etc.)

2. **Second Priority**: Create the Flutter SDK
   - Will make it easy for developers to adopt our solution
   - Can implement offline support as part of the SDK
   - Will help validate our API design from a client perspective

3. **Third Priority**: Security Rules
   - Important for production apps
   - Can be added after the core real-time features

I suggest we tackle WebSockets first because:
1. It's a core infrastructure piece that the SDK will need
2. It's easier to design the SDK with real-time support from the start
3. Many Firebase features (presence, real-time queries) depend on it
4. It will help us validate our data model with real-time updates

Would you like to proceed with WebSocket implementation, or would you prefer to start with the Flutter SDK?
